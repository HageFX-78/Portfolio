                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <P class="sub-title">Sliding</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mechanic that allows the player to slide through obstacles with height lower than the player.</li>
                    <li>Acts similarly to a sprint button, by holding down 'Ctrl' button, player can move at 1.5x the speed on the horizontal axis.</li>
                    <li>Can be paired with Jump, jumping while sliding will perform a higher jump which makes jumping on top of higher obstacles possible.</li>
                    <li>Player however cannot perform slapping in this state.</li>
                </ul>
                <P class="sub-title">Gliding</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>A simple mechanic that allows the player to glide  while mid-air.</li>
                    <li>Lowers fall speed to around half the original value.</li>
                    <li>Player however cannot perform sliding in this state.</li>
                </ul>
                <P class="sub-title">Slapping</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic melee attack that could kill any enemy with a slap!</li>
                    <li>Has a fairly short range but can be performed in any state other than sliding.</li>
                    <li>Has a small cooldown of 0.5 seconds to prevent spamming.</li>
                </ul>
