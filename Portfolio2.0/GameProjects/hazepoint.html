<b>Brief</b><br>

First unreal engine game made for Final Year Project. Still currently being devloped!<br>

The game is mainly a mech simulator where you have to kill a kaiju 10x the size of the player. The mech is equipped with some utilities that could help traverse the map, attack the kaiju and mainly survive.<br><br>

There is no core mechanic per say, but the one mechanic that could be considered the main is the grapple ability. Player can grapple onto any building within a set distance, reel towards it OR reel halfway and dangle around. You could imagine it being similar to the classic attack on titan tribute game on PC quite a few years back.<br><br>

<b>Notable Features</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>Grapple mechanic, grapple onto structures in a set distance and have the ability to reel towards it. Reeling halfway allows the player to 'hang' around like spiderman. This allows player to jump off building without accumulating too much fall damage and have a way to quickly traverse and scale the landscape.</li>
    <li>Scanning shader, a tool equipped onto the mech to scan more interactables on the map such as cars to destroy and alert the kaiju. A side functionality is to scout the landscape surrounding the player as the map tend to get pretty dark.</li>
    <li>Drone deployment, set a static area on the map whereby if the kaiju enters it, it will notify the player.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>C++ in Unreal</b><br><br>

As this is my first time dabbling with Unreal, I've attempted to mix blueprint and C++ to get a feel of the system, I managed to create scripts for enemy(the large kaiju) pathfinding with Dijkstra algorithm as I wanted to test implementing a simpler algorithm. This took way longer than expected as there a bunch of hurdles on both the editor and Unreal's own C++ framework, the result wasn't as satisfactory either. <br><br>

To elaborate, the patfinding code works and always returns a path, the next part where Unreal's behaviour tree system somehow fails to find the next path on random intervals. I've tried to debug this issue for a week and nothing seemed to make sense, I am absolutely certain my code was working as a path is returned everytime the previous one ends, but the behaviour tree clears the path at very random intervals with no notable patterns. <br><br>

Due to time constraints, I've decided to switch to pure blueprint part for finding the path and focus more on player experience namely the mech. I would tackle C++ later on once I've have a better grasp to the underlying paradigm of Unreal through blueprints.<br><br>

<b>Context on what PathFindingManager is working with : </b>
<ul>
    <li>A custom object class to store an array of path rerturned by the pathfinder (this is because Uneral's blaackboard component doesn't accept arrays as keys for some reason)</li>
    <li>A custom waypoint actor that is placed on the map to act as path points, each contain data linking to other waypoints</li>
</ul>

<b>Flow of PathFindingManager :</b>
<ol>
    <li>Determine kaiju initial location by finding the closest waypoint to it</li>
    <li>Set it as start position and randomly select another waypoint as end point on the map</li>
    <li>Pass both data as parameters to FindPath() function to find the path</li>
    <li>Function returns a path by setting the aforementioned custom array class as key in Unreal's built-in blackboard</li>
    <li>Blackboard checks if the key has changed, executes the path</li>
</ol>
