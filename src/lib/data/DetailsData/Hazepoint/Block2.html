<b>Context on what PathFindingManager is working with : </b>
<ul>
	<li>
		A custom object class to store an array of path rerturned by the pathfinder (this is because
		Uneral's blaackboard component doesn't accept arrays as keys for some reason)
	</li>
	<li>
		A custom waypoint actor that is placed on the map to act as path points, each contain data
		linking to other waypoints
	</li>
</ul>
