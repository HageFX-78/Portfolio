<b>Brief</b><br />

<p>First solo project made on unreal engine 5 for Final Year Project.</p>

<p>
	The game is mainly a mech simulator where you have to kill a kaiju 10x the size of the player. The
	mech is equipped with some utilities that could help traverse the map, attack the kaiju and mainly
	survive.
</p>

<p>
	There is no core mechanic per say, but the one mechanic that could be considered the main is the
	grapple ability. Player can grapple onto any building within a set distance, reel towards it OR
	reel halfway and dangle around. You could imagine it being similar to the classic attack on titan
	tribute game on PC quite a few years back.
</p>
<br />

<b>Notable Features</b><br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Grapple mechanic, grapple onto structures in a set distance and have the ability to reel towards
		it. Reeling halfway allows the player to 'hang' around like spiderman. This allows player to
		jump off building without accumulating too much fall damage and have a way to quickly traverse
		and scale the landscape.
	</li>
	<li>
		Scanning shader, a tool equipped onto the mech to scan more interactables on the map such as
		cars to destroy and alert the kaiju. A side functionality is to scout the landscape surrounding
		the player as the map tend to get pretty dark.
	</li>
	<li>
		Drone deployment, set a static area on the map whereby if the kaiju enters it, it will notify
		the player.
	</li>
</ul>

<b>C++ in Unreal</b><br />

<p>
	As this is my first time dabbling with Unreal, I've attempted to mix blueprint and C++ to get a
	feel of the system, I managed to create scripts for enemy(the large kaiju) pathfinding with
	Dijkstra algorithm as I wanted to test implementing a simpler algorithm. This took way longer than
	expected as there a bunch of hurdles on both the editor and Unreal's own C++ framework, the result
	wasn't as satisfactory either.
</p>

<p>
	To elaborate, the pathfinding code works and always returns a path, the next part where Unreal's
	behaviour tree system somehow fails to find the next path on random intervals. I've tried to debug
	this issue for a week and nothing seemed to make sense, I am absolutely certain my code was
	working as a path is returned everytime the previous one ends, but the behaviour tree clears the
	path at very random intervals with no notable patterns.
</p>

<p>
	Due to time constraints, I've decided to switch to pure blueprint part for finding the path and
	focus more on player experience namely the mech. I would tackle C++ later on once I've have a
	better grasp to the underlying paradigm of Unreal through blueprints.<br /><br />
