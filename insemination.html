                <P class="sub-title">Bullet Leveling</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the name implies, a mechanic that raises bullet level up to a maximum value of 5.</li>
                    <li>Player need to collect 10 "Pills" to raise a bullet level.</li>
                    <li>Each bullet provides different amounts and types of bullet fired.</li>
                    <li>Dying even once however will reduce the level back to 1 but all lost "Pills" will spawn right above where the player dies providing a chance to reacquire them.</li>
                </ul>
                <P class="sub-title">Sneak/Focus Fire</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mechanic inspired from a similar mechanic in Touhou.</li>
                    <li>By holding down shift, player can half their movement speed as well as focus all bullets upwards.</li>
                    <li>Only applicable at bullet level 2.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Implementation: Bullet Leveling</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I first identify the general rules of the mechanic:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maximum level for bullet upgrade is 5</li>
                            <li>Require 10 "Pills" to upgrade one bullet level.</li>
                            <li>Player gain "Pills" by colliding with one.</li>
                            <li></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Next I implement the conditions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is done by calculating if the total pills acquired goes over 50, then set it to 50 contantly.</li>
                            <li>Every 10 pills acquired, bullet level will be added 1 to it.</li>
                            <li>Basically when player collides with a "Pill" actor, the pill acquired variable will be incremented.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Then one by one I set the bullet counts for each type of bullets based on the bullet level manually as they are pre-set.</li>
                    <li>The custom event shown in the image will trigger everytime player collides with a "Pill", checking the amounts of pill acquired and setting their respective levels.</li>    
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h3>Implementation: Sneak/Focus Fire</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A very simple mechanic where if the Shift button is held down, set movement speed to half of itself, if released, set it to original movement speed (stored in a seperate variable).</li>
                    <li>By holding down Shift, a global variable known as "Sneak" state is set to true, false if released, this helps governs the angle bullets fire, hence creating a focus fire effect, this can referenced from the image beside.</li>    
                </ol>
